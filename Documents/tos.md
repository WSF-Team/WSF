## 1. Service (Read This Carefully)
We sell **iDevice signing certificates**
They are provided **“as is”**

We are **NOT affiliated with Apple Inc.**  
Apple controls the certificates. Once issued, **we do not**.

---

## 2. No Guarantees (Zero, None, Nada)
We do **not** guarantee:
* Certificate lifespan  
* Protection from revocations  
* Protection from blacklists  

Apple may revoke certificates **at any time**, for any reason.  
That is **out of our control and not our responsibility**.

Once your certificate is delivered, the service is **completed and fulfilled**.

---

## 3. No Refunds / Stripe Disputes
This is a **digital, irreversible service**. Therefore:
* **ALL SALES ARE FINAL**
* **NO refunds**
* **NO chargebacks**
* **NO Stripe disputes**

Filing a **Stripe dispute or chargeback** is a direct violation of these Terms.

By purchasing, you acknowledge that:
* The service is delivered immediately
* You waive **all rights** to dispute the payment

**Refunds are ONLY provided if:**
* We completely fail to provide the product  
* Your device has **not** been processed  

Anything else? **No refund.**

---

## 4. User Responsibility (Yes, This Is On You)
You are fully responsible for:
* How you use the certificate
* Complying with all applicable laws (piracy, abuse, etc.)
* Providing **accurate and correct information**

If you provide:
* An incorrect **UDID**
* The wrong device information
* Someone else’s device details
* Any incorrect data at all

That is **100% your responsibility**.  
**No refunds. No replacements. No exceptions. No crying.**

---

## 5. Discord & Support Policy
All support is tied to our **Discord server**.

* Support and warranty exist **only while you remain in good standing**
* If you are **banned, kicked, or removed from Discord**, you immediately lose:
  * Support
  * Warranty
  * Replacement eligibility

We provide **general support only** (installation guidance, basic help).  
We have the **final say** in all support-related matters.

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability
We are **not responsible** for:
* Revoked certificates
* Blacklisted devices
* Any actions taken by Apple

Our total liability is:
**Nothing. Zero. Null. Nada.**

We provide **no warranties, protection, or guarantees**.  
You receive the certificate you paid for — **our obligation ends there**.

---

## 7. Changes
These Terms may change at any time without notice.  
By purchasing, you automatically accept the latest version.

---

## 8. Contact
Support is provided **ONLY** through our official Discord:  
https://wsfteam.netlify.app/discord

Do **not** expect support through any other platform.

### Instant Certificate Notice

“Instant” means **anything under 4 hours**. This is much better than the default 3 day wait.

Most certificates are processed in **under 5 minutes**, but delays can happen because this is **a partially automated service**.

Processing is **fast and reliable**, but not magical.  

You **will** receive your certificate ASAP when we are available.

Best,  
WSF Team
