# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** 22/01/26

By purchasing our iDevice certificate services, you confirm that you have **read, understood, and accepted** these Terms.

If you do not agree to these Terms, then you should not buy.

If you have agreed to these Terms, then you are ready to buy.

---

## 1. Service
We sell **iDevice signing certificates**.

They are provided **“as is”**, with the exception of any **explicitly purchased revoke protection**.

We are **NOT affiliated with Apple Inc.**  
Apple controls the certificates. Once issued, **we do not**.

---

## 2. Guarantees & Revoke Warranty
We do **not** guarantee:
* Certificate lifespan outside of purchased revoke protection  
* Protection from Apple policy changes  
* Protection from Apple blacklists  

Apple may revoke certificates **at any time**, for any reason.

However:

If you purchase **revoke protection**, we offer an **unlimited revoke warranty** for the **exact period you selected**.

This means:
* Your certificate may be revoked **any number of times** during that period
* We will **replace the certificate each time** at no additional cost

If, for any reason, we are **unable to replace your certificate** during an active revoke protection period:
* You will receive a **refund of the revoke protection fee only**
* The original certificate purchase remains non-refundable

Once your certificate is delivered, the base service is **completed and fulfilled**.

---

## 3. No Refunds / Stripe Disputes
This is a **digital, irreversible service**. Therefore:
* **ALL SALES ARE FINAL**
* **NO refunds**
* **NO chargebacks**
* **NO Stripe disputes**

Filing a **Stripe dispute or chargeback** is a direct violation of these Terms.

By purchasing, you acknowledge that:
* The service is delivered immediately
* You waive **all rights** to dispute the payment

**Refunds are ONLY provided in special cases if:**
* We completely fail to provide the product  
* Your device has **not** been processed  
* We are unable to honor an **active revoke protection**, in which case **only the revoke protection fee** is refunded

Anything else? **No refund.**

---

## 4. User Responsibility
You are fully responsible for:
* How you use the certificate
* Complying with all applicable laws (piracy, abuse, etc.)
* Providing **accurate and correct information**

If you provide:
* An incorrect **UDID**
* The wrong device information
* Someone else’s device details
* Any incorrect data at all

That is **100% your responsibility**.  
**No refunds. No replacements. No crying.**

---

## 5. Support & Revoke Warranty Policy
All support is tied to our **Discord server**.

* Support and revoke warranty exist **only while you remain in good standing**
* If you are **banned, kicked, or removed from Discord**, you immediately lose:
  * Support
  * Revoke warranty
  * Replacement eligibility

Replacements under revoke protection are provided **at our discretion**, limited to certificate revocations only.

We provide **general support only** (installation guidance, basic help).  
We have the **final say** in all support- and warranty-related matters.

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability
We are **not responsible** for:
* Apple actions or policy changes
* Blacklisted devices
* Any damages resulting from certificate use

Our total liability is limited to:
* **The revoke protection fee only**, and **only if** we cannot fulfill an active revoke warranty

Beyond this:  
**Zero. Nothing. Null. Nada.**

We provide **no additional warranties or guarantees** beyond what is explicitly stated.

---

## 7. Changes
These Terms may change at any time without notice.  
By purchasing, you automatically accept that the latest version will be the TOS in effect.

---

## 8. Contact
Support is provided **ONLY** through our official Discord:  
https://wsfteam.netlify.app/discord

Do **not** expect support through any other platform.

---

### Instant Certificate Notice
“Instant” means **anything under 4 hours**.

Most certificates are processed in **under 15 minutes**, but delays can occur due to this being a **partially automated service**.

Processing is fast and reliable, but not guaranteed to be instant.

You **will** receive your certificate ASAP when we are available.

Best,  
**WSF Team**
